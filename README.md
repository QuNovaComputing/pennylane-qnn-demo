# Using Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network for MNIST Digits Classification

This repository contains an example of using a hybrid
quantum-classical neural network to perform 10-class MNIST digits
classification.

### Steps:
1. **Install dependencies:**

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Choose if you want to open the jupyer notebook
   "mnist\_example\_pennylane.ipynb" or run the script
   "mnist\_example\_pennylane.py". Both contain the same code, but the
   notebook is split into cells and has additional text cells.
